# Virtual To Physical To Virtual

Project created for the Future Internet Technologies course (TIP-23 project).

The goal of this project is to convert the configuration of a virtual (Kathara project) topology with various networking protocols running to the same working topology with the same protocols but on physical Cisco devices, and vice versa.

Physical devices must support Netconf protocol with yang models.

Refer to [environment/README.md](environment/README.md) for VM setup guide.
