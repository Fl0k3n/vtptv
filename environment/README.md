Vagrantfile with ansible playbook that configures ubuntu20 VM with docker + kathara, requirements:
- linux
- `vagrant` tool
- `ansible playbook` tool

Feel free to change VM specs in `Vagrantfile` if the current ones require too much resources.

In this directory run:
1. `vagrant up`
2. `vagrant ssh` to access the VM

Run `vagrant halt` when you are done using the VM.
